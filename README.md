### AlgorImage, a C project that entirley generates a Demo by it's self<sup>\*</sup>.

\* AlgorImage uses ffmpeg for the last bit where it compiles the images into the mp4.

## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Make sure you have GCC and Make installed. *duh*
2. Make sure you have ffmpeg installed
3. To make the program that generates the images, run make
4. To fully generate the video in one shot all the way to the mp4 file, run "Make run".
5. "Make run" just executes the shell script I included in the `out/` folder.

I made this in Linux. There is no windows version. There will never be one. :)
